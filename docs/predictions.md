# Predicting the position

JPL offer an [ephemeris calculator](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi#top) which can be used to predict the position of any minor planet in the minor planet catalogue.

Using this tool the next opposition of the object is predicted for 2020-11-20 when it will be at RA 03 10 08 and Dec 25 25 57
in the constellation of Aries.

[See the ephemeris](./ephemeris_opposition_2020.md) for the next opposition.


Star charts for the area can be generated using [SkyMap](http://www.avastronomyclub.org/skymap/d/skymap.php)
