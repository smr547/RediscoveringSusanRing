# Predicting the position

JPL offer an [ephemeris calculator](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi#top) which can be used to predict the position of any minor planet in the minor planet catalogue.


## Next oppositon 
Using this tool the next opposition of the object is predicted for 2020-11-20 when it will be at RA 03 10 08 and Dec 25 25 57
in the constellation of Aries.
