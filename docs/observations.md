# Observations

The sky is being monitored by a number of automated observatories throught the world (?reference?). These observatories 
regularly detect Minor planets such as [7779 Susanring](https://minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=7779)
and report the observations are sent to the [IAU Minor Planet centre](https://minorplanetcenter.net/) which catalogues the
data and uses them to refine the orbital parameters of the object.
